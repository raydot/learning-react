		/*  
			Using Factories 

			Instead of using React.createElement, we can use factories.
			A factory is a special object that can be used to abstract away the details
			of instantiating objects.  In React, we use factories to help us create React
			element instances.

			React has built in factories for all commonly supported HTML and SVG DOM elements,
			and you can use the React.createFactory function to build your own factories around
			specific components.
		*/

		// Instead of using createElement (see '070_component_createClass.html') we can create a 
		// React element with a built in factory:

		// React.DOM.h1(null, "Baked Salmon")
		// In this case, the first argument is for properties and second for children.  

		//	Here are factories using an unordered list:
		// React.DOM.ul({"className": "ingredients"},
		// 	React.DOM.li(null, "1 lb Salmon"),
		// 	React.DOM.li(null, "1 cup Pine Nuts"),
		// 	React.DOM.li(null, "2 cups Butter Lettuce"),
		// 	React.DOM.li(null, "1 Yellow Squash"),
		// 	React.DOM.li(null, "1/2 cup Olive Oil"),
		// 	React.DOM.li(null, "3 cloves of Garlic")
		// )

		// THIS DOES NOT WORK IN REACT 16!

		// NOW LETS USE MAP WITH FACTORIES (also doesn't work in 16)

		var items = [
			"1 lb salmon",
			"1 cup pine nuts",
			"2 cups butter lettuce",
			"1 yellow squash",
			"1/2 cup olive oil",
			"3 cloves of garlic"
		]

		var list = React.DOM.ul(
			{ className: "ingredients" },
			items.map((ingredient, key) =>
				React.DOM.li({key}, ingredient)
			)
		)

		ReactDOM.render (
			list,
			document.getElementById('react-container')
		)
